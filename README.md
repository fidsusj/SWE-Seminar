## Research planning

### Central research question

Which approaches for automatic system test generation using contract enriched use cases within a transition system 
simulation model as well as using sequence diagrams exist?

### Snowballing

Question                                     | Answer
-------------------------------------------- | --------
Research source                              | IEEE Xplore

### Search term based search

Following search terms were chosen for doing research on the central research question:
- system tests
- automatic generation
- transition system
- simulation model
- use cases
- contracts
- sequence diagrams

__Generic search term:__ "system testing" AND "automatic generation" AND "transition system" AND "simulation model" AND
"use cases" AND contracts AND "sequence diagrams"

__Research Sources:__ IEEE Xplore<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, ACM<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>

__Explanation:__ Pre-search results were promising both on IEEE Xplore and ACM. Only some papers on ACM could not be accessed publicly. 

### Relevance criteria

- Does the method described in the article generate system tests automatically from use cases and other means of the specification area like sequence diagrams?
- Are test objectives generated using some kind of simulation model based on use case contracts (pre- and postconditions) 
or similar transition system approaches?

__Explanation:__ 
- As system tests can not exclusively be derived from means of the specification area, an article should 
restrict to generating system tests from use cases explicitly. Supporting artifacts to generate test scenarios are not prohibited in case they originate
from the specification area.
- To derive test objectives the correctness and consistency of use case combinations should be tested based on their contracts
(pre- and postconditions)

####Backward snowballing (46 initials results)

Direct references from the base article have been evaluated in case they were extensively mentioned in the _Related Work_ 
chapter. Other references relate to preceding work that was taken as a basis to build the transition system approach and
shouldn't be further taken into consideration. Another restriction is as in the forward snowballing that only whitepapers 
from IEEE Xplore or ACM got evaluated.

Boundary coverage criteria for test generation from formal models                                                                 | No        | Not in the context of automatic system test generation
Requirement-Based Automated Black-Box Test Generation                                                                             | Possibly  | The approach accepts a sofhvare specijication as a set of individual requirements expressed in textual and SDL formats (a common practice in the industry). The system model is used to automatically generate test cases related to individual requirements.

- \#Initial results: (min 50)
- Explain why articles where not chosen according to relevance criteria
- Choose at least one article
- Execute further restrictions on the search criteria

### Choosing one article

- Justify new criteria and the decision which article is chosen
- Document why articles were not chosen
