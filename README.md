## Research planning

### Central research question

Which approaches for automatic system test generation using contract enriched use cases within a transition system 
simulation model as well as using sequence diagrams exist?

### Snowballing

Question                                     | Answer
-------------------------------------------- | --------
Research source                              | IEEE Xplore
_Show references to publication_ existent    | True
_\#Articles_ referencing the article         | 140
_\#Articles_ referenced from the article     | 46
 
### Search term based search

Following search terms were chosen for doing research on the central research question:
- system tests
- automatic generation
- transition system
- simulation model
- use cases
- contracts
- sequence diagrams

__Generic search term:__ "system testing" AND "automatic generation" AND "transition system" AND "simulation model" AND
"use cases" AND contracts AND "sequence diagrams"

__Research Sources:__ IEEE Xplore<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, ACM<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>

__Explanation:__ Pre-search results were promising both on IEEE Xplore and ACM. Only some papers on ACM could not be accessed publicly. 

### Relevance criteria

- Does the method described in the article generate system tests automatically from use cases and other means of the specification area like sequence diagrams?
- Are test objectives generated using some kind of simulation model based on use case contracts (pre- and postconditions) 
or similar transition system approaches?

__Explanation:__ 
- As system tests can not exclusively be derived from means of the specification area, an article should 
restrict to generating system tests from use cases explicitly. Supporting artifacts to generate test scenarios are not prohibited in case they originate
from the specification area.
- To derive test objectives the correctness and consistency of use case combinations should be tested based on their contracts
(pre- and postconditions)
 
## Research execution

### Snowballing based search (forwards and backwards oriented)

####Forward snowballing (140 initial results)

Title                                                              | Relevance | Explanation       
------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | -----------------------------------------------
Consistency Reflection for Automatic Update of Testing Environment / No        | Not in the context of automatic test generation


####Backward snowballing (46 initials results)

- \#Initial results:
- Explain why articles where not chosen according to relevance criteria
- Choose at least one article
- Execute further restrictions on the search criteria
