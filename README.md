# Research planning, research and mid-term presentation

## Research planning

### Central research question

Which approaches for automatic generation of system tests exist that are using contract enriched use cases or other 
use case related means of the specification area within a transition system simulation model?

### Snowballing

Question                                     | Answer
-------------------------------------------- | --------
Research source                              | IEEE Xplore

### Search term based search

Following search terms were chosen for doing research on the central research question:
- system tests
- automatic generation
- transition system
- simulation model
- use cases
- contracts

__Generic search term:__ "system testing" AND "automatic generation" AND "transition system" AND "simulation model" AND
"use cases" AND contracts

__Research Sources:__ IEEE Xplore<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, ACM<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>

__Explanation:__ Pre-search results were promising both on IEEE Xplore and ACM. Only some papers on ACM could not be 
accessed publicly. The amount of results should be sufficient to cover all relevant scientific papers.

### Relevance criteria

- Does the method described in the article generate system tests automatically from use cases or other use case related 
means of the specification area?
- Are test objectives generated using some kind of simulation model based on use case contracts (pre- and postconditions) 
or similar transition system approaches?

__Explanation:__ 
- As system tests can not exclusively be derived from means of the specification area, an article should 
restrict to generating system tests from use cases. Supporting artifacts to generate test scenarios are not 
prohibited in case they originate from the specification area.
- To derive test objectives the correctness and consistency of use case combinations should be tested based on their 
contracts (pre- and postconditions)

### Backward snowballing (46 initials results)

Direct references from the base article have been evaluated in case they were extensively mentioned in the _Related Work_ 
chapter. Other references relate to preceding work that was taken as a basis to realise the transition system approach and
shouldn't be further taken into consideration. Another restriction is as in the forward snowballing that only papers 
from IEEE Xplore or ACM got evaluated.

__IEEE Xplore:__

Most of the references where quite old since the original paper was published in 2006. Therefore not all papers could be found on IEEE Xplore or ACM.

Test cases generation from UML state diagrams                                                                                     | Yes       | Uses UML state diagrams and transforms them into extended finite state machines (EFSMs)
Requirements by Contracts allow Automated System Testing                                                                          | Yes       | First we propose a contract language for functional requirements expressed as parameterized use cases. Then we provide a method, a formal model and a prototype tool to automatically derive both functional and robustness test cases from the requirements enhanced with contracts.
Use of Sequencing Constraints for Specification-Based Testing of Concurrent Programs                                              | No        | No use case driven approach
Boundary coverage criteria for test generation from formal models                                                                 | No        | Not in the context of automatic system test generation
Requirement-Based Automated Black-Box Test Generation                                                                             | Possibly  | The approach accepts a software specification as a set of individual requirements expressed in textual and SDL formats (a common practice in the industry). The system model is used to automatically generate test cases related to individual requirements.

### Choosing one article

Eight relevant articles remain after the initial search:

- System Testing using UML Models
- An Automatic Tool for Generating Test Cases from the System's Requirements
- Automated Test Case Generation from Use Case: A Model Based Approach
- Requirements Document Based Test Scenario Generation for Web Application Scenario Testing
- An Approach to Modeling and Testing Web Applications Based on Use Cases
- Test cases generation from UML state diagrams
- Requirements by Contracts allow Automated System Testing 
- An Automated Approach to System Testing Based on Scenarios and Operations Contracts

The decision criteria are based on the different search terms above mentioned and the already defined criteria. Additionally,
focus of the selected paper should lie on creating system tests for any generic application area, not just UI parts of an application. 

The paper _An Automatic Tool for Generating Test Cases from the System's Requirements_ was not chosen as it does not focus
on testing the consistency of use case combinations with contracts to build test objectives as in the original paper. Furthermore,
it is not as in-depth as the original paper. Contract enriched use cases could neither be found in _System Testing using UML Models_.

_Automated Test Case Generation from Use Case: A Model Based Approach_ really embodies the principle of state base modeling 
based on use cases with its _interaction finite automaton_ (IFA), but doesn't introduce a formal language to define use cases
and its contracts. 

_Requirements Document Based Test Scenario Generation for Web Application Scenario Testing_ as well as 
_An Approach to Modeling and Testing Web Applications Based on Use Cases_ are specifically optimized for web application 
test scenarios and therefore not as general and universally applicable as the original paper.

_Test cases generation from UML state diagrams_ and _Requirements by Contracts allow Automated System Testing_ could 
unfortunately not be accessed in full length in IEEE Xplore. 

The chosen article to further evaluate is _An Automated Approach to System Testing based on Scenarios and Operations Contracts_, 
as it introduces a second way to create system tests from use case scenarios as UML 2.0 models by enriching it with contracts and 
by transforming the formalized scenarios to a transition system to validate test objectives. Further information on the paper will be
introduced in the mid-term presentation.
